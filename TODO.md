* WIP: Add construction of the Gitfile subcommand `generate-config`
* add `status` subcommand to see which local repositories have unstaged/uncommited changes or are seating on a feature branch
* improve Auth mechanism in all provider specific code - maybe use singleton
* improve test coverage
* aggregate log entries for each item - to print like these would be run sequentially
* potentially add more providers gitea, AWS CodeCommit, Azure DevOps Git, Google Cloud Source Repositories, Launchpad, 
* Evaluate: https://github.com/fluxcd/go-git-providers to simplify code
