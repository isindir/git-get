* maybe: add ability to use multiple Gitfiles and multiple Gitfile.ignore
  * https://github.com/spf13/cobra/issues/661
* maybe: add ability to exclude/include repositories by regex in config-gen
* add support for gitea
* use goreleaser to release new versions
* improve test coverage
* improve Auth mechanism in all provider specific code - maybe use singleton
* maybe: aggregate log entries for each item - to print like these would be run sequentially
* potentially add more providers: AWS CodeCommit, Azure DevOps Git, Google Cloud Source Repositories, Launchpad, other?
* Evaluate: https://github.com/fluxcd/go-git-providers to simplify code
